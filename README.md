This is the bibtexbrowser fork of the Institute of Phonetics and Speech Processing (LMU Munich).

This fork includes changes that were necessary to make bibtexbrowser fit the IPS's website and data. Most of the changes are probably interesting for the upstream public as well.

The official website of the IPS is <http://www.en.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/>.
The official website of bibtexbrowser is <http://www.monperrus.net/martin/bibtexbrowser/>.
